Kimba the white lion, the code name for the king,
He's feared by cheaters, but loved by those who bring,
Their best to the table, in the ALX SE program,
Where Julien and G lead, and dreams become grand.

The program's hard, the intensity's high.
Some students try to cheat, to get by,
But Kimba's the protector, of the brand and the name,
Without him, the reputation would go down in flames.

Cheating's not an option, when Kimba's around,
He's the watchdog, making sure we're sound,
In this intensive programme, we push to the max,
But Kimba's our guide, and keeps us on track.

So let's give it up, for the king of the code,
Kimba the white lion, who guards our digital abode,
So let's keep striving, and never give up the fight,
Kimba and Alex, keep us honest and upright.

And as this song comes to an end.
Our love and gratitude we send.

Do Hard things!
